## Why is a Mughal emperor who died 300 years ago being debated on social media?

The Mughal emperor Aurangzeb was very pro-Islamic. He had many Hindi shrines and temples destroyed under his rule, with Muslim mosques being built over them. He also imposed harsh taxes on the entire Hindi population in India but forced nothing on Muslims. Recently, nationalists in India have been saying that because of these crimes Aurangzeb committed against Hindi people hundreds of years ago, Muslims should be punished and oppressed as payback for what Aurangzeb did. His name is a good rallying point for these people, even if it does belong to someone who died long ago.

## In the opinion of this author, what makes Aurangzeb the "ideal prince"?

TL;DR: He followed religious practices, helped people, respected knowledge, and memorized the Qur'an.

Aurangzeb strictly adhered to religious guidelines, praying at all appropriate times and with the common people. He always gave alms properly to the mosques and people, and and he made it very easy for Muslims to make their mandatory pilgrimage to Mecca. He showed lots of respect to scholars, and had libraries built to allow for greater knowledge within his own population. He also memorized the entire Qur'an, wrote two copies of it, and ensured that the members of his household would also respect the holy book.
