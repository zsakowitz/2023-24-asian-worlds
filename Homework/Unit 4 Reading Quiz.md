Watching the people in his court argue led Akbar to realize that true religious adoption can only come through actual belief, and that imposing religion on a country through coercive means would never give the same levels of conviction that true belief would. When believers of various religions came to Akbar's hall and argued over whose religion was the truest, Akbar saw an intensity in their debate that could only have come from true believers. The will and strength of these people to argue for hours on end would never have happened if they had been coerced into accepting their various religions. Akbar realized this, saying that doing acts of a religion only to avoid a ruler's wrath would never make a person amount to anything in the eyes of God. This knowledge led Akbar to understand that he would never be able to convert anyone to Islam, as they would all accept his offer immediately, presuming that terrible consequences would come if they didn't. This in turn led to Akbar being more permissive and tolerant of other religions, knowing that his subjects would do anything they thought he wanted in order to move up in the tree of power and respect. And so the debate between religions in Akbar's hall led to a realization that he could never convert people out of fear, which consequently led to an increase in religious tolerance throughout his rule.
