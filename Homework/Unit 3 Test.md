Prompt for [[Unit 3 â€“ Early Empires]] test: write about how China and South Asia were unified by two of the following: morals/religion, laws/legal principles, and standardization, proving an example for both China and South Asia in each prompt.
## Morals/Religion

In China, Confucianism was a dominant force throughout the [[Han Dynasty]], unifying the Chinese people through good conduct. Confucianism asked the Chinese people to always follow the path of good morality by being kind to each other, and recognizing that true kindness needed to be something that one acted on, rather than something that one did passively, as greetings and pleasantries so often are these days. When everyone was kind to all who they met, they developed a unified sense of identity as good people, and as those who showed extreme courtesy in the home. This was especially a differentiating factor from those who the Chinese believed to be barbarians, who they stereotyped as being mean-spirited people with no soul and no will for goodness. In South Asia, [[Hinduism]] bound people into tight-knit groups by having several different yogas, or methods of achieving enlightenment, the specifics of which could be decided in small villages and groups. Some families and their neighbors might decorate a local statue of a god with wreaths and jewelry of their own making, whereas others might study their holy books with a passion. Each of these was considered correct in [[Hinduism]], despite their stark differences, and so Hindi people grew to not only have a small-scale sense of closeness with those who they practiced yoga with, but also with those who had vastly different methods of achieving enlightenment. Thus, Confucianism helped unify China's people through morality and good conduct, and [[Hinduism]] helped unify South Asia's people through shared rituals and the appreciation of others'.

_Non-canon side comments (feel free to ignore them): Looking over this, it feels like I'm making the argument that Confucianism unified China on a broader scale than [[Hinduism]] did to South Asia. It's a very interesting idea, and I feel like you could argue for either side with a bit more evidence._
## Laws/Legal Principles

While the caste system of South Asia served primarily as a method of giving the kings and priests ultimate power, it also had the powerful side effect of unifying much of South Asia. The caste system divided people up into four groups, each with its own responsibilities and rights, and the people of these castes learned to work together in order to accomplish tasks and be more difficult to be put down by higher castes. Sudras tending to crops in a field might learn it was easier to transport crops if two people carried a basket, and they might remark on how the day had been, and could easily talk to each other due to having no social boundaries separating them and due to have having had shared experiences. China also had legal principles that helped people to stick together. [[Legalism]] is a fascinating example here, for although it is not often talked about as much of as a bonding experience so much as the strict orders of a terrible regime, it did force the people of China to have much more trust in those they were close with. If people ever did so much as a minor infraction, they had to be sure that everyone they were in contact with trusted them, or at least didn't care enough to report them, or at least wasn't paranoid enough to think that the other person might report them for something, or at least was in a deadlock with the opposing person, each knowing the other's secret of breaking the law. And so we can see that as the caste system unified the people of India, so too did [[Legalism]] unify the people of China under a single set of laws, even if it did so in a very dystopian manner.

_Non-canon side comments (feel free to ignore them): Could there have been better options for laws and legal principles for China? Yes. But I thought it might be interesting to write about [[Legalism]] from the perspective of unification, even if something else might be a more typical response._
