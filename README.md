My notes for my 2023-24 Asian Worlds class.

Recommended reading method:

1. Install [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).
2. Clone this repository by running
   `git clone https://github.com/zsakowitz-notes/2023-24-asian-worlds` in your
   Terminal.
3. Open the repository as a new Obsidian Vault. It's probably in your home folder.
	- On MacOS, open your "Desktop" folder, then hold the Command key and press the up arrow. You should see a folder called "2023-24-asian-worlds".
4. Allow plugins to run (if you're worried about security, install them yourself).
5. Open the settings for Obsidian Git and set "Vault backup interval" to `0`.
6. Done!
