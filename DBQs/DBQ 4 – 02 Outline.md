When working on the outline for this, I immediately saw the ideas described in "Porcelain and silk," namely that those two items were in high demand to traders. But I quickly realized that that would be a very boring and repetitive essay, and so I moved into a completely different topic: "Opportunities and religious tolerance." But then I had an idea on how to expand "Porcelain and silk" into "Materials and security", and so I now have three outlines.

I will most likely either use "Materials and security" or "Opportunities and religious tolerance". A good idea would be to write a paragraph for each and see how they stack up. Or to write both paragraphs for each and compare them. I'll probably do one of those, depending on how much time I want to spend on this.

Also important: I quoted the sources directly here, even though I definitely don't need the entire quotes. This is so that I never have to look at the source packet again, which is important because a) I can focus on only the parts I'm using in my DBQ and b) I have PTSD from looking at the source packet for too long. I'll reduce them later.

Hopefully this isn't too much for you to look through.

It's barely 1546 words.

This is probably graded on completion, I'm not actually sure you'll actually see this. Oh well.
